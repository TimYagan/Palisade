Data Access Policy Management and Enforcement\nStatus\n\nPalisade is still in the early stages of development.\nAt the moment there are a few simple examples to show how Palisade could work - it is not production ready.\nThe description of Palisade below indicate the high level goals of the framework. \n\nDocumentation\nThe documentation for the latest release can be found here.\nComplex data policies\nModern data organisations store lots of datasets that are each managed and accessed according to different data access policies. These policies can be complicated and it can be difficult to store and access datasets for analysis across different technologies while ensuring compliance.\nMost technologies don't provide the necessary hooks out of the box for managing these complex data access policies. This leads to data being siloed or accesses and APIs being restricted and insight from data is lost. \nPalisade is a set of services for managing and enforcing complex data access policies across different scales and platforms. It provides modular data access controllers and independent, peripheral services to allow policies to be applied before clients access the data.  \nFor example, datasets may have been assembled for specific purposes and, for a given dataset, only particular types of query are permitted for certain types of user. Also, within each dataset a specific user may only be permitted to access a particular subset of the records. Palisade allows the policy for accessing datasets, redacting records and executing the query to be specified independently of the physical data and the platform hosting the data.\nPolicies can be applied on a per field basis. This means that fields (e.g. cells) in a record can be redacted or masked based on the contents of the record, the user accessing the record and the contextual information given at query time by the user or system.\nWhen a user submits a query (or executes some analytic code), Palisade uses the information about the user, the platform and the data requested, to look up the relevant data access policy. This policy is then used by a process, which ideally should be a data-local process to get the best performance, to return only the records that are allowed by the policy for the specific user, dataset and query time context. \nMulti-platform compatibility\nPalisade aims to provide a stable framework for defining and enforcing policy and auditing requirements for data access requests while allowing you to keep up with the fast-changing world of data science tools. Palisade does that by sharing with the community the burden of creating connectors to new data storage technologies and the connectors from new data processing technologies into Palisade. Palisade is not dependent on any platform ecosystem such as Hadoop, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Google.io, etc. \nCentralised or Local Policy\nIf required, Palisade allows an organisation to use centralised services which each deployment of Palisade's data access services can share. This means that your data access policies, audit logs, user account details etc. don't need to be duplicated on every system. Of course, Palisade can still be deployed locally on a per platform basis.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nGit\nMaven\nDocker\n\nThe examples may have additional prerequisites\n\nWe do not currently support Windows as a build environment, If you are running on Windows then you will need this: Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package\n\nGetting started\nTo get started, clone the Palisade repo: \ngit clone https://github.com/gchq/Palisade.git\n\nWe have examples that demonstrate the automated policy rule enforcement when users read some data.\nThese examples should provide a good start to understanding how Palisade works.\nFor an overview of the examples click here.\nFor more details about the code structure see the Developer Guide\nFor details about possible types of clients and how they might function, click here\nLicense\nPalisade is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License and is covered by Crown Copyright.\nContributing\nWe welcome contributions to the project. Detailed information on our ways of working can be found here.\nFAQ\nWhat versions of Java are supported? Java 8 with plans to upgrade to Java 11+ soon.\n"},"doc/other/ways_of_working.html":{"url":"doc/other/ways_of_working.html","title":"Ways of Working","keywords":"","body":"Ways of Working\nContents\n\nGit branching model\nIssues\nPull requests\nCoding style\nReleases\n\nGit branching model\nWe have adopted the following branching strategy: Git Branching Model\nIssues\nWhere possible a pull request should correlate to a single GitHub issue. An issue should relate to a single functional or non-functional change - changes to alter/improve other pieces of functionality should be addressed in a separate issue in order to keep reviews atomic.\nThe reasoning behind code changes should be documented in the GitHub issue. \nAll resolved issues should be included in the next GitHub milestone, this enables releases to be linked to the included issues.\nIf a code change requires users to make changes in order for them to adopt it then the issue should be labelled 'migration-required' and a comment should be added similar to:\n### Migration Steps\n\n[Description of what needs to be done to adopt the code change with examples]\nWorkflow\n\nAssign yourself to the issue\nCreate a new branch off develop using pattern: gh-[issue number]-[issue-title]\nCommit your changes prefixing your commit title with: gh-[issue-number] - [commit title]\nCheck your changes\nCreate a pull request to merge your branch into develop (and assign label in-review to your issue)\nThe pull request will be reviewed and following any changes and approval your branch will be merged into develop\nDelete the branch\nClose the issue - add a comment saying it has been merged into develop\n\nPull Requests\nPull requests will undergo an in depth review by a Palisade committer to check the code changes are compliant with our coding style. This is a community so please be respectful of other members - offer encouragement, support and suggestions. \nAs described in our git branching model - please raise pull requests to merge you changes in our develop branch.\nPlease agree to the GCHQ OSS Contributor License Agreement before submitting a pull request.\nCoding style\nPlease ensure your coding style is consistent with rest of the project and follow coding standards and best practices.\nIn particular please ensure you have adhered to the following:\n\nStrive for small easy to read and understand classes and methods.\nSeparate out related classes into packages and avoid highly coupled classes and modules.\nCheckstyle is run as part of 'mvn package' so you should ensure your code is compliant with these. The project will not build if there are issues which cause these plugins to fail.\nClasses and methods should comply with the single responsibility principal.\nAvoid magic numbers and strings literals.\nAvoid duplicating code, if necessary refactor the section of code and split it out into a reusable class.\nLook after your streams - if you open one make sure you close it too. This should apply to all volatile resource usage.\nDon't swallow exceptions - ensure they are logged or rethrown.\nGive credit for other peoples work.\nUpdate the NOTICES file for changes to the dependencies.\nConsider the scope of dependencies - restrict them when possible using the appropriate maven scope.\nDon't expose private logic in classes through public methods.\nTry to avoid static classes/methods.\nField access should be controlled via getters and setters.\nMake use of the core Java API - don't reinvent the wheel.\nMake use of generic typing.\nMake use of appropriate object oriented design patterns.\nUse Loggers instead of System.out.print and Throwable.printStackTrace.\nEnsure that the toString(), equals() and hashCode() methods are implemented where appropriate.\n\nJavadoc\nEnsure your java code has sufficient javadocs explaining what the section of code does and the intended use of it. Javadocs should be used in addition to clean readable code, it is not an excuse to write lazy code.\nIn particular:\n\nAll public classes (not required for test classes unless an explanation of the testing is required)\npublic methods (not required if the functionality is obvious from the method name)\npublic constants (not required if the constant is obvious from the name)\n\nTests\n\nAll new code should be unit tested. Where this is not possible the code should be invoked and the functionality should be tested in an integration test. In a small number of cases this will not be possible - instead steps to verify the code should be thoroughly documented.\nTests should cover edge cases and exception cases as well as normal expected behavior.\nKeep each test decoupled and don't rely on tests running in a given order - don't save state between tests.\nOverall for a given code change aim to improve the code coverage.\nUnit test classes should test a single class and be named [testClass]Test.\nIntegration test classes should be named [functionalityUnderTest]IT.\nTests should be readable and self documenting where possible. \nEach test should focus on testing one small piece of functionality invoked from a single method call. \nUnit tests should use JUnit 4.x.\nWe suggest the following pattern:\n@Test\npublic void should[DoSomething|ReturnSomething] {\n    // Given\n    [Setup your test here]\n\n    // When\n    [Invoke the test method]\n\n    // Then\n    [assert the method did what was expected]\n}\n\n\n\nReleases\n\nAll issues included in the release should be marked with the relevant milestone\nWhen the develop branch is ready to be released create a pull request to merge develop into master\nMerge the pull request\nTravis CI will carry out the release in 2 stages\nInitially it will see the pom version is a SNAPSHOT, this will trigger it to tag the \nrelease based on the SNAPSHOT version or you can define the version by setting the environment variable RELEASE_VERSION in Travis CI settings. \nAfter tagging the release it will update the Javadoc and generate the release notes.\nIt will then update the develop branch and update the pom version to the next SNAPSHOT version.\nTravis CI is then automatically triggered on master for a second time, now with a pom version that does not contain a SNAPSHOT. \nIt will now build the binaries and release them to Nexus.\n\n\nOnce Travis CI has finished both stages:\nLog into Nexus\nGo to the staging environment\nSelect the artifacts\nClick 'close'\nClick 'release' - this will release them to Maven Central.\n\n\n\n"},"doc/developer-guide/developer_guide.html":{"url":"doc/developer-guide/developer_guide.html","title":"Developer Guide","keywords":"","body":"Developer Guide\nThe following gives some useful documentation intended to help with the developer onboarding experience.\n\nInitial Requirements - the initial design requirements for Palisade.\n\nDesign Principles - the principles used throughout the design process.\n\nHigh level architectural diagram\n\nHigh level architecture using a map reduce client\n\nDescription of each component\n\nStandard flow for a read request through the Palisade system - Message Sequence Chart (MSC) covering this flow\n\nHow might the system be deployed?\n\nSecurity considerations - design thoughts on security\n\nRoadmap for Palisade - where Palisade is heading.\n\nWays of Working - developer guide to branching strategy etc.\n\n\n"},"doc/developer-guide/initial_requirements.html":{"url":"doc/developer-guide/initial_requirements.html","title":"Initial Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Initial Requirements\nMust have\n\nCan use a data access policy that is local, centralised corporately, or mix of both.\nCan use attributes about users to apply policies, with that user data being local, centralised corporately, or a mix of both.\nCan use attributes about the query time context of the data access to apply policies, with that context attributes being supplied by the user, client or palisade service.

The main reason this gets tricky is because we expect Palisade to be used to access data in a distributed way over a cluster.\nTherefore the client authentication token is only going to be available on the machine that the client is running the client code on and not necessarily available at the point at which the distributed code is requesting the data from the data services.\nThat is why we have to register the data request with the palisade service first in a non-distributed way where you can provide a personal token/certificate to be validated to ensure authentication.\nThen the palisade service can then provide a token to be passed to the data service to authenticate that the same already authenticated user is requesting access to the desired resource.\nThe data service validates the token with a palisade service and uses it to get the required trusted details from a cache service that is shared by all instances of the palisade service.\nThis is to satisfy Hadoop's security architecture. In environments where users run as themselves (as opposed to everybody running as the Hadoop processing user), we can do client-auth at on connection to the PalisadeService and again at the connection to DataService.\nThe underlying mechanism still works identically, but we can then also validate that Token A that Alice is passing to the DataService was originally issued to Alice by the PalisadeService.

Then the Spark client would then take the response of that request and split the list of resources over the number of executors Spark is running and get each executor to request access to the subset of resources assigned to that executor.\nThe data service receives the request for data and passes that request to the palisade service to validate the request and to get the data access policies that apply to those resources. Then the data service can read the resource applying the column selection (columns requested plus any columns required to apply the policy) then apply the policies, transform the data so only the two requested columns are returned and then stream the data back to the executor that made the request.\nThen the Spark client can format the stream of data into a DataFrame so that the standard Spark code can do the rest of the request.\nTherefore as far as the user is concerned they just had to add the option and use the different format, as they would not be able to access the data via any of the other formats. This keeps the API similar to Spark's standard read API. \nUsing the 'cat' command line tool\nIt should be possible to use command line tools like 'cat' to be able to view files that are being protected by Palisade. \nTo do that we would need to write a client that mimics the behaviour of the 'cat' command but routing the request for data via Palisade. \nThen you could alias 'cat' to run that client code. \nTherefore to the end user there is again very little difference to how they would normally use 'cat' if they did not have the data access policy restrictions.\nSee cat-client for the implementation of this client.\nCreating an S3 client endpoint\nIt should be possible to create an S3 endpoint that allows any out of the box data processing technology that supports S3 to route requests via Palisade. \nThis mechanism would require a way to register your user supplied information such as the purpose for your query to a separate service which provides you a token to embed in the resource URL.\nThen the client would be able to go to strip out the context token and retrieve the contextual information to be used by Palisade.\n"},"service/":{"url":"service/","title":"Services","keywords":"","body":"Services\nA collection of the different Palisade Services.

A non-goal of the audit service is to provide general logging support. Therefore, debug logs and so-forth should not be routed to the audit service. The output of the audit service can be useful for policy auditors for compliance checks and to monitor how rules are being applied. It may also be useful for follow-on machine processing to generate metrics on what data is being accessed, how often, by whom and for what reasons (purposes).\nPalisade is designed for flexible deployment, therefore it is not assumed that all nodes within a cluster have unfettered access to the external network. It may be the case, that only specific cluster \"edge\" nodes are able to communicate externally to/from the cluster. Consequently, another role of the audit service is to function as a central location for the remainder of the Palisade components which themselves may not have external communication. Other services can send audit events to the audit service which can collate and store the events for later review.\nNote that while the audit service provides a central place for audit logging to occur, this doesn't imply that the audit service is a singleton, in a micro-services deployment it is likely that several instances of the same audit service are present in a deployment. It will not matter which particular instance receives an individual audit event.\nIt may also forward certain events on to another non-Palisade service. This allows for the creation of \"auditing alerts\". For example, organisational rules may require that an alert is sent when a particularly sensitive type of action is taken or resource accessed.\nImplementations of the audit service may also include proxies to forward the messages to another Audit service, aggregator's to reduce the volumes of logging to be stored as well as implementations that actually write the logs to storage.\nBy splitting the functionality of the audit components in this way, where they all implement this interface but do some small processing before passing to the next component, for example proxy -> receiver -> aggregator -> storage.\nIt means that if we don't want to aggregate audit records then we just remove the aggregator implementation when building that micro-service.\nAPI Usage\nBearing in mind the notice above, the AuditService class currently only defines one method.\n\nvoid audit(final AuditRequest request)\n\nHopefully little explanation is needed of what this method does, but it is worth stating that the actual action taken by an implementation of AuditService may depend on what is being audited. For example, a simple note of a request being made could simply be written to the audit log, but repeated, denied requests for a resource by a specific user may result in an escalation whereby an alert is raised.\n"},"service/cache-service/":{"url":"service/cache-service/","title":"Cache Service","keywords":"","body":"Cache Service\nNote: As noted in the documentation root Palisade is in an early stage of development, therefore the precise APIs contained in these service modules are likely to adapt as the project matures.\nOverview\nThe core API for the cache service.\nThe purpose of the cache service is to act as a short term caching layer between \na service and a backing store that ultimately stores the data for the duration \nof the TTL.

Note that we are avoiding having a separate notion of \"Palisade\"\" users that are distinct from the normal user accounts of the system. There is no such thing as a \"Palisade\"\" user.\nOne of the purposes of this service is to allow Palisade to adopt the whatever notion of user the host environment has. For example, this may from a central directory service such as LDAP, host operating system account or PKI based user authentication.\nThe user service separates this concern from the rest of the system. Other components use this service's API to request user details. Some deployments may also allow Palisade to add users to the system, hence the presence of the addUser() method in the UserService interface.\nAPI Usage\nCurrently the UserService supports adding and retrieving of user details via the two following API calls.\n\nCompletableFuture getUser(final GetUserRequest request) throws NoSuchUserIdException\n\nCompletableFuture addUser(final AddUserRequest request)\n\n\nThe addUser method is used in the example code to allow the configuration of new users for Palisade. The request object contains the details of the user to add. The getUser method allows the retrieval of user details via the User's ID. This is provided to Palisade when the User object is created.\nNotes\nThe API is reasonably simple at present and it is likely that this interface will grow.\nSpecifically, we anticipate that UserService implementations will connect to a account provisioning service as explained above, which will let Palisade retrieve the details of users that it previously knows nothing about. That is, we do not expect that every user retrieved via getUser will have previously been added via a corresponding addUser call.\n"},"service/config-service/":{"url":"service/config-service/","title":"Config Service","keywords":"","body":"Config Service\nNote: As noted in the documentation root Palisade is in an early stage of development, therefore the precise APIs contained in these service modules are likely to adapt as the project matures.\nOverview\nThe core API for the config service.\nThere are two public methods which are get() and add().\nThe purpose of the config service is to centralise the configuration of all the \nPalisade services in a single deployment. This makes it easier to support rolling \nupgrades and minimise the amount of bootstrap information each service requires \nto be bundled in the deployment jar.\nThe config service is designed to provide basic information to a service to allow it to initialise\nitself and start functioning. One of the principle pieces of information provided by the config\nservice will be the locations of other Palisade services. For example, given Palisade service A\nthat depends on talking to service B, when service A starts up the information it receives from\nthe config service should tell it how to contact an instance of service B. Thus, the only information\nthat a service needs to have beforehand (i.e. its bootstrap information) is how to contact the\nconfig service.\nDesign\nThe config service has a simple interface. The get() API returns a ServiceConfiguration object\nwhich is a map of string key/value pairs that is handed back to the service that made the request.\nThe only information that the config service needs on a get request is the service class making the\nrequest. This information is contained in the GetConfigRequest object.\nThe returned ServiceConfiguration should contain only the information relevant and necessary to\nthat service. It should not contain information relating to other services in a production environment\n(though this maybe acceptable for test environments) and should not contain unnecessary information\nas that encourages bloat and increases the chances of an information leak between services.\nOne crucial key in the map should be the name of class to instantiate for a given service\nclass. For example, having retrieved the ServiceConfiguration for the service class PalisadeService\ntheir should be a mapping from a key of PalisadeService to SimplePalisadeService (as an example) which implements\nit. This is needed so the correct implementation of a service can be instantiated.\nAuthentication and authorisation is a separate concern; however, we note here how crucial this is\nto the config service since there is likely to be sensitive information stored by it that should\nnot be handed out to anonymous clients.\nClients can request their configuration from the config service by making a get request with\nan empty service field in the GetConfigRequest. This signifies to the config service to only\nprovided the minimal and safe configuration data to the requester. Nominally for a client,\nthis might only include the location of where to find an instance of the PalisadeService since\nthat is the client's entry point into the system.\nThe config service differs from other services in one crucial but necessary way: it must be able\nto start and enter a running state on its own. It must contain enough bootstrap information to\ninitialise itself without talking to another external service. The amount of bootstrap information\nshould still be minimal though, i.e. to allow the config service to make itself basically functional.\nIt doesn't need to contain full information to allow the config service to become fully operational.\nThe ConfigurationService class contains a configureSelfFromConfig() method that acts as the second\nstage of config service initialisation. Essentially, this allows the config service to achieve full\noperational status by loading any extra information from the stored configuration. This \"self-configuration\"\nallows the bootstrap information to kept to a minimum. An example is below:\n\nConfig service starts up and reads its bootstrap information.\nConfig service uses bootstrap information to connect to backend storage.\nConfig service is now able to retrieve further information it might need about itself from\nbackend storage.\nConfig service calls configureSelfFromConfig() to complete its configuration, e.g. credentials\nfor sensitive configuration data.\nConfig service is now fully operational.\n\nOperation\nEach Service class in Palisade has two methods which should be self-explanatory in name:\napplyConfigFrom() and recordCurrentConfigTo() to load and save their configuration data to and\nfrom a ServiceConfiguration object respectively. The first is the more important as this is what\nthe Configurator class will call to set up instances of Palisade services with information that it\nhas obtained from the config service.\nThe general form of a Palisade service initialisation works in the following order of play:\n\nLoad details of config service from bootstrap information.\nRepeatedly try to contact the config service to retrieve configuration information.\nCall applyConfigFrom() to configure service.\nService then enters runnable state.\n\nConfigurator\nAs most of the details of creating services and retrieving the configuration information from\nthe config service are the same across services, then this class provides convenience methods\nfor doing so.\nThe methods contained in the Configurator class allow for the creation of a service from a given\nconfiguration and more importantly, creating a runnable service from a service class name and a\nconfig service. It also provides timeout variants on all methods to allow the user to make the choice\nbetween retrying indefinitely or failing after a given amount of time.\nThe Configurator class also allows for certain configuration keys to be overridden via Java system properties. The\nmethods in that class accept a list of regular expressions that specify which keys can be overridden. For example, if\nservice A starts up and wishes to allow configuration keys for its storage provider to be set manually from system properties,\nthen it calls a method in this class with an override regex of ^.*\\.storage\\.backend.*$. Thus, if the ServiceConfiguration provided by the config\nservice contained the key primary.storage.backend.class, then as this matches the regex, a similarly named system property\nwould replace the value in the ServiceConfiguration.

The test names state briefly what is being tested, e.g. \"read_small_native\" is a read of\nthe smaller data file without using Palisade, \"read_large_with_policy\" is a read of the larger file via Palisade with policy enforced.\nThe general naming scheme is \"test_size_variant\".\nOnce you have completed building below, you can get detail on each test by running:\n./example/deployment/bash-scripts/perf.sh help run\n\nUsage\nBuilding\n\nTo use the performance tool, you must first build Palisade (from the Palisade root directory):\nmvn clean install -P example\n./example/deployment/local-jvm/bash-scripts/buildServices.sh\n\nYou can then run the following command to start the Palisade services running on your local machine.\n./example/deployment/local-jvm/bash-scripts/startAllServices.sh\n\nWait for those to initialize, then switch to a new terminal:\n./example/deployment/bash-scripts/perf.sh\n\nSetting up\nWithout arguments, the tool will give some usage information.\nThe first step is to create some data for the tool to test against. For the performance tests, we use a \"small\" file and a \"large\" file.\nYou can decide the number of HR records to go in the small and large files (depending on how long you want the tests to run!), or even\nmake them the same size!\nFirst, we tell Palisade where its bootstrap configuration file is:\nexport PALISADE_REST_CONFIG_PATH=./example/example-model/src/main/resources/configRest.json\n\nNow, to create some test data in a perf_test directory:\nmkdir perf_test\n./example/deployment/bash-scripts/perf.sh 1000 10000 perf_test\n\nThis will produce output similar to:\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Going to create 1000 records in file employee_small.avro and 10000 records in file employee_large.avro in sub-directory\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Creation tasks submitted...\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Small file written successfully true\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Large file written successfully true\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Copying small file\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Copying large file\n\nWe must then instruct Palisade to create some compliance policies regarding these files:\n./example/deployment/bash-scripts/perf.sh policy perf_test\n\nThis then produces:\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Specified path perf_test has been normalised to file:////Palisade/perf_test/\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Security policy has been set for file://///Palisade/perf_test/employee_small.avro: true\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Security policy has been set for file://///Palisade/perf_test/large/employee_large.avro: true\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Security policy has been set for file:////Palisade/perf_test/employee_small-nopolicy.avro: true\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Security policy has been set for file://///Palisade/perf_test/large/employee_large-nopolicy.avro: true\n\nRunning\nNow we can run the performance tests:\n./example/deployment/bash-scripts/perf.sh run perf_test 2 5\n\nThe first number is the number of \"dry runs\" to perform; these are tests where the results are discarded to allow JVM optimisation/class loading\noccur and not interfere with the results. The second number is the number of live runs to perform.\nDepending on the size of the files you created, this may take some time to run. Output will be similar to the following:\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Specified path perf_test has been normalised to file:////Palisade/perf_test/\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Starting dry runs\nStarting test read_large_native:10000\n\n>>\n\nexample.perf.Perf INFO  - Starting live tests\nStarting test read_large_native:10000\n\n>>\n\nAll times in seconds.\n\nTest                              # trials         Min         Max        Mean    Std.dev.         25%         50%         75%         99%        Norm\nread_small_native                    5.000       0.064       0.081       0.072       0.007       0.066       0.069       0.078       0.081       1.000\nread_large_native                    5.000       0.660       1.199       0.840       0.198       0.709       0.727       0.906       1.187       1.000\nrequest_small_with_policy            5.000       0.114       0.242       0.190       0.047       0.156       0.215       0.221       0.241       0.000\nread_small_no_policy                 5.000       0.158       0.500       0.234       0.133       0.163       0.170       0.180       0.487       3.264\nread_small_with_policy               5.000       0.266       0.507       0.384       0.103       0.271       0.382       0.491       0.507       5.348\nread_large_with_policy               5.000       1.609       3.603       2.128       0.749       1.624       1.876       1.930       3.536       2.533\nread_large_no_policy                 5.000       1.360       1.759       1.513       0.147       1.415       1.430       1.602       1.753       1.801\n\nThe tool reports several statistics, but the most useful are the mean and standard deviation.

Using this library allows you to define your\nPalisade Policy rules in standard reusable way without having to\ncreate lots of similar java classes. It also provides a mechanism\nfor extracting fields from objects/tuples and passing them directly to\nfunctions/predicates.\nThis allows commonly used Koryphe functions, such as IsMoreThan, to be applied against a record's field, such as timestamp, without having to implement and create new java functions in the code.\nWithout Koryphe Rules\nEach rule must be implemented in code like with the below example from IsExampleObjRecent. \npublic class IsExampleObjRecent implements Rule {\n    private long threshold;\n\n    public IsExampleObjRecent() {\n    }\n\n    public IsExampleObjRecent(final long threshold) {\n        this.threshold = threshold;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public ExampleObj apply(final ExampleObj record, final User user, final Context context) {\n        if (null == record) {\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        final boolean isRecent = record.getTimestamp() > threshold;\n        return isRecent ? record : null;\n    }\n}\n\nIn the this example the threshold value is passed in at the constructor and the > logic is implemented within the apply() method, but this method is also responsible for getting the correct field from the record ExampleObj.getTimestamp().\nTo implement the same logic against either a different field or object, would require a new implementation of a similar class with duplicated logic.\nUsing Koryphe Rules\nThe logic of a Koryphe predicate rule is reusable, because only threshold value and the field selection/projections changes.\nPredicates\nThe below example from ExampleSimpleClient shows a rule named \"ageOff\". This rule applies the IsMoreThan function with a threshold of 12, against the \"timestamp\" field within a Record object. To apply the same rule against another field or object only the selection argument needs to be changed.\nnew TupleRule()\n    .selection(\"Record.timestamp\")\n    .predicate(new IsMoreThan(12L))\n\nNested Selection\nThe Koryphe rules are applied against a tuple with named fields (or by default wrapped in a inefficient Reflective Tuple). This allows selecting nested fields within a record or object, i.e. select(\"library.room.shelf.book.paragraph.sentence.word\"), without having to implement the logic within Java code, provided the fields or getMethods for the structures are public.\nFunctions\nThe below example is how Koryphe rules can be used to manipulate a record. In this case we are setting 'new value' on the record. \nnew TupleRule()\n    .selection(\"Record.value1\")\n    .function(new SetValue(\"new value\"))\n    .projection(\"Record.value1\")\n\n\nA selection is made \"Record.value1\" (in this example the selection isn't used)\nA predicate is applied, in this example the there is no logic other that a value is created \"new value\"\nOutput is written to the projection, in this example the projection is the same as the original selection \"Record.value1\"\n\nIf Logic\nThe below example from ExampleSimpleClient shows how decision logic can be applied using Koryphe rules. \nnew TupleRule<>(ExampleObj)\n        .selection(\"User.roles\", \"Record.property\"),\n        .function(new If<>()\n            .predicate(0, new Not<>(new CollectionContains(\"admin\")))\n            .then(1, new SetValue(\"redacted\"))\n\nThe selection has two values selection(\"User.roles\", \"Record.property\") these can be referenced within the If function by their respective keys (0,1).\nIn the example the predicate is applied against the '0' selection \"User.roles\", when evaluated as true the function within the \".then\" method is executed otherwise the function in the \".otherwise\" function (not shown in the example.) This examples shows the value \"redacted\" being written to the selection '1'/\"Record.property\".\n"},"client-impl/":{"url":"client-impl/","title":"Client Implementations","keywords":"","body":"Client Implementations\nThe job of the client code is to send the request for data into Palisade and to interpret the result as required for the data processing technology it is written for.\nThe responsibility for implementations of the client code is to provide users with a way to request data from Palisade in a way that the user has to make minimal changes to how they would normally use that processing technology.\nImplementations of this component will usually require deep understanding of the data processing technology in order to best hook into that technology, without needing to fork the code for that technology.\nThis directory contains the various client implementations for Palisade that have currently been written.

This simple \ncache service can then persist those key value pairs by using a backing store that \npersists the data. The cache service supports a TTL which is the TTL of the data \nset to the backing store.\nOperation\nBacking Stores\nThe simple cache service abstracts the details of how the data is stored from the deserialisation by splitting the\nstorage responsibilities off into a BackingStore. A backing store is the lowest level of abstraction and only deals\nwith a flat key space and the storage of byte sequences. A backing store implementation must connect to the data\nstorage facility and only needs to provide basic guarantees to its behaviour. It must also implement the time to live\nfunctionality required by the interface.\nAs well as storing the byte array data associated with a key, a backing store must also store the Java class type of the\ncached object. How this is performed is left unspecified, however a common way is to add a second key to the backing store\nwhose value stores the name of the class associated with a given key. An example of this can be found in PropertiesBackingStore.\nSimple cache service\nAt the next abstraction layer above the backing store is the SimpleCacheService which works independently of the backing\nstore implementation. The job of the cache service is actually very simple. It takes cache requests and a key and either\nstores or retrieves the value associated with it. As stated above, the backing store only needs to implement a flat key\nspace, so the separation of services is performed at this level. The cache service takes the service class and the given\nkey and combines them to make a unique key. This key is then passed down to the backing store.\nValues are encoded into byte arrays by way of a cache codec. Various cache codecs are used by the cache service (see below)\nto serialise and deserialise Java objects into byte arrays. Custom ones can also be registered by way of the codec registry.\nCache codec registry\nA simple cache service has an associated cache codec registry. The registry maintains pairs of matching functions that\nmay serialise and deserialise objects of specific types into byte arrays. This allows for different types to be serialised\nin different ways thereby enabling the most efficient form of serialisation for an object type to be used as well as\nallowing customisation of the process. When the cache receives a request to store a value of type T, it first consults the\nregistry to see if a codec pair for T has been registered. If not then a default serialiser is used. A similar process\nis followed for retrieving objects from the cache.\nBy default, several codecs are registered. Custom codecs are provided for byte arrays and String objects since these can\nbe efficiently serialised (the byte array codec is simply the identity function). A default implementation that uses\nJSON serialisation is provided for all other object types. If a particular type of object that has a more efficient\nserialisation method available is going to regularly placed in the cache, then it is encouraged to provide a custom\ncodec and register it with the codec registry.\n"},"service-impl/cache-service-impl/hashmap-backing-store/":{"url":"service-impl/cache-service-impl/hashmap-backing-store/","title":"Hashmap Backing Store","keywords":"","body":"HashMap backing store\nA simple implementation of a backing store that simply stores the key value pairs\nin a ConcurrentHashMap.
